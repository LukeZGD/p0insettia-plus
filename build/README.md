### Install Loader / Zebra  
The first step is to add the loader app to the rootfs of the device.  
Please set the device to **pwned DFU Mode**. Use [Legacy iOS Kit](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit) (Useful Utilities -> Send Pwned iBSS) or [iPwnder Lite for iOS](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Pwning-Using-Another-iOS-Device). Then run the following script.
```
./ramdisk_boot.sh
```

The device will reboot and enter recovery mode.  
Please set the device to **pwned DFU Mode** and run the following script.
```
./tethered_boot.sh

The device will reboot and enter recovery mode.  

### Reboot and setup Zebra
Perform the initial startup. Please set the device to **pwned DFU Mode** and run the following script.
```
./tethered_boot.sh
```

- Zebra should appear on the home screen after waiting for a few minutes.

### Fix recovery mode
Now, when you try to reboot your device, it will boot in recovery mode. Connect the device in recovery mode to USB and run the following script.  
```
./fix_recovery.sh
```

The device will reboot and boot in non-jailbreak mode. If you want to boot in a jailbreak environment again, set the device to **pwned DFU mode** and run the following script.
```
./tethered_boot.sh
```
